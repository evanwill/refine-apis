# refine-apis

A basic intro to OpenRefine and fetching data from web APIs for digital humanities thinking of "collections as data".

Based on my other workshops:

- [clean your data](https://evanwill.github.io/clean-your-data/)
- [Hey API!](https://evanwill.github.io/hey-api/)
- [Fetching and Parsing Data from the Web with OpenRefine](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/fetch-and-parse-data-with-openrefine)
